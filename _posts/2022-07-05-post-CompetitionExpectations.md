Frequently I see riders getting frustrated and upset at their ponies and themselves that the show “didn’t go to plan”, when in reality they had unrealistic expectations of themselves. These kinds of expectations almost always lead to feeling not good enough and overall dissatisfaction with your results.
 
This is something I struggled with for a long time, I used to be very critical of myself, over analyzing my rounds at shows. However, since changing my definition of success I have found shows more enjoyable than ever.
 
It's important to understand that competing is solely a chance to either; have some fun or challenge yourself. At the end of the day riding horses is a sport where you are constantly learning and evolving. Horses are very complex creatures and there are so many variables that could go wrong or right on the day. It is important to focus on factors inside of your control to help you redefine success for you and your equine, instead of comparing your results to others. 
 
 
Redefine what success means to you, instead of asking yourself “Did I win the class?” or “Did I do better than the other riders?” consider these other definitions of success;
 
* Was there something I learned from this show?
* Was I kind to my horse and gave them a positive experience?
* Did I make some progress towards my short term or long term goals?
* Did I have fun?
* Did I support and encourage other riders?
* Can I make a plan of what to improve for the next show?
* Did either my horse or I accomplish something new or challenging?

These are just a few of my definitions of success I use for shows. By changing this definition you are likely to feel more confident when competing because you have less pressure on yourself and your horse to perform perfectly. Whether it was learning something new or just having a fun time you are bound to leave the show feeling much more positive about the experience.
