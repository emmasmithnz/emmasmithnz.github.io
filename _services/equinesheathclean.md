Routine sheath cleaning is very important for the well being and comfort of your gelding. Symptoms of a horse with a bean/dirty sheath can include; bucking, kicking out, cross cantering and swelling through the loins (behind saddle). We reccomend having your gelding cleaned at least every 6 - 12 months depending on the horse. Feel free to get in contact with us and book in a session.
