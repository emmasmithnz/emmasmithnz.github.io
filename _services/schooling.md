We have onsite spaces avaiable from November, please get in contact to secure a spot.

Whether you have a young/green horse or a horse in need of a refresher, we have different packages available to suit you and your equines need. We have a 60x20 all weather arena with full set of jumps, an obstacle paddock, farm riding and river access. 

Here are some of the skills we can teach your horse/pony:
- Jump undersaddle
- Walk, trot, canter on a contact and loose rein
- Stand at the mounting block
- Basic lateral movement
- Hack out alone and with others
- Navigate obstacles/water undersaddle
- Lunge both directions

We specialise in problem horses, identifying the cause of the behaviour and working with the horse to correct it. We also provide a training plan for the horse once they return home to contninue their education. 

We do not currently offer offsite schooling.
