We also take on young horses (2-4 year olds) to give them a solid foundation to prepare them for being started. This is usually over a period of 2-4 weeks depending on the horse and their needs. Your horse will learn the following skills:
- Navigate obstacles
- Wear a rug
- Basic groundwork (Rein back, side pass, moving off pressure etc)
- Float loading
- Lunge both directions
- Lead out over the farm
- Pick up all feet

We have spaces available from November, please get in contact to secure your place.
