My name is Emma and I am an equestrian located in the lower North Island. I been working with horses for many years. I love working with my team of showjumpers and project ponies, solving problems, educating and ensuring they are able to enjoy their work.

I strongly beleive horses have a reason for behaviours. Our responsibility as a rider and owner is to identify the cause and help the horses work through and fix these to ensure our horses are able to enjoy their work.

It is important to allow horses time to process and understand in order to create a enjoyable learning environment. Using positive reinforcement and ground work exercises have been hugely benefitial with my team of horses. I am excited to continue to learn and gain a greater understanding of equine behaviour and horsemanship.
