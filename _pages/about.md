My name is Emma and I am an equestrian located in the lower North Island. I been working with horses for many years. I love working with my team of showjumpers and project ponies, solving problems, educating and ensuring they are able to enjoy their work.

I strongly beleive horses consistently have a reason for behaviours. Our responsibility as a rider and owner is to identify the cause and help the horses eliminate these causes to ensure our horses are able to enjoy their work. Is my horse reacting to the girth being done up because he just dosn't feel like being ridden? Most likely there is somthing deeper to look into.
