Ripple has been apart of my team since Feburary 2020. Last season he placed second in the open horse 1.10 at the Hawkes Bay A&P show as well as having his first 1.20 start. I am looking forward to continuing riding him as he is such a genuine, smart jumper. 

**Brighton Rock**   -    16.0hh 6 year old Stationbred X Gelding

Ronald joined my team in June 2021. I bought him as a project to bring on over winter, but quickly fell in love with his attitude and underlying talent. He is currently in his first season of competing and is proving to be a very smart jumper. He has picked up a fair few ribbons throughout the season as he stepped up to competing 1m. I look forward to seeing what he gets up to next season. 

**KSE Capio**   -    emh 16hh 2 year old Captivate VWNZ gelding



Capi joined the team in April 2022. He is a lovely young horse, already has a great attitude towards learning. It will be exciting to see him grow up and start being ridden undersaddle. I am hoping to start him around March 2023.

**Indiana**     -    15hh 15 year old Thoroughbred Mare by Indian Danehill

Indi was my first horse who joined me in March 2016. Throughout the past years Indi and I have learnt so much from each other. She's very cool and cruisy and has a love for jumping. Indi is currently leased on site to a lovely young rider and enjoys going on adventures and showing another rider the ropes.
