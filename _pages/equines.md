## Ripple ST (Ripple)
{% include feature_row %}

Ripple has been apart of my team since Feburary 2020. He is a 9 year old gelding by Rip Van Winkle out of Tina Temple. During the 2021 season he placed second in the open horse 1.10 at the Hawkes Bay A&P show as well as having his first 1.20 start at series final. He is brave and sharp which makes him so much fun to compete. 

## Brighton Rock (Ronnie)
{% include feature_row id="feature_row2" %}

Ronnie has been apart of my team since June 2021. He is a 7 year old stationbred gelding. I originally bought him to produce as a project over winter, but he has exceeded expectations and is staying on the team. He has a suberb jump and great temperment with looks to match. He competed up to 90/1m last season with wins and placings.  

## KSE Capio (Capi)
{% include feature_row id="feature_row3" %}

Capi became apart of my team in April 2022. He is a rising 3 year old by Captivate VWNZ out of KSE Riverdance Magic. He is a lovely well put together young horse. Capi already has a great attitude towards learning and loves playing with tarps and balls on the arena. It will be exciting to watch him grow up. He will be started undersaddle in 2023.

## Harley
{% include feature_row id="feature_row4" %}

Harley joined us in Februrary 2022. He is a 11 year old gelding by Whittlewood Balaram out of a thoroughbred mare. 

## Indiana (Indi)
{% include feature_row id="feature_row5" %}

Indi is my first horse and joined us in March 2016. She is a 16 year old mare by Indian Danehill out of Symphius. Throughout the past years Indi and I have learnt so much from each other. She's a very fun ride and loves jumping. Indi is currently leased on site to a lovely young rider.
