Ripple has been apart of my team since Feburary 2020. Last season he placed second in the open horse 1.10 at the Hawkes Bay A&P show as well as having his first 1.20 start. I am looking forward to continuing riding him as he is such a genuine, smart jumper. 

**Brighton Rock**   -    16.0hh 2015 Stationbred X Gelding

Ronald joined my team in June 2021. I bought him as a project to bring on over winter, but quickly fell in love with his personality. He is currently in his first season of competing and is proving to be a very smart jumper. He has picked up a fair few ribbons throughout the season as he stepped up to competing 1m.

**KSE Capio**   -    emh 16hh rising 3 year old Captivate VWNZ gelding

Capi joined the team in April 2022. He is a lovely young horse, already has a great attitude towards learning. It will be exciting to see him grow up. He will be started undersaddle in 2023.

Indi was my first horse who joined me in March 2016. Throughout the past years Indi and I have learnt so much from each other. She's very cool and cruisy and has a love for jumping. Indi is currently leased on site to a lovely young rider and enjoys going on adventures and showing another rider the ropes.
