Ripple has been apart of my team since Feburary 2020. Last season he placed second in the open horse 1.10 at the Hawkes Bay A&P show as well as having his first 1.20 start. I am looking forward to continuing riding him as he is such a genuine, smart jumper.

Ronald joined my team in June 2021. I bought him as a project to bring on over winter, but quickly fell in love with his attitude and underlying talent. He is currently in his first season of competing and is very flash yet easy going. He has picked up a few ribbons throughout the season and is currently stepping up to 1m. I look forward to seeing what he gets up to next season. 

**Indiana**     -    15hh 15 year old Thoroughbred Mare by Indian Danehill

Indi was my first horse who joined me in March 2016. Throughout the past years Indi and I have learnt so much from each other. She's very cool and cruisy, loves jumping. Indi is currently leased on site to a lovely young rider and is loving going on adventures and being fussed over.
